== 3.2 JPA and Spring Data JPA

We use the Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) to map the relational data to Java objects (see xref:../../src/main/java/cde/chameleon/locations/entity/LocationEntity.java[LocationEntity]).

With Spring Data JPA, we can easily define JPA based repositories and reduce boilerplate code. We just write a repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring Data JPA will provide the implementation automatically (see xref:../../src/main/java/cde/chameleon/locations/entity/LocationJpaRepository.java[LocationJpaRepository]).
