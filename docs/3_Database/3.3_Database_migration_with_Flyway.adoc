== 3.3 Database migration with Flyway

We do database migration with Flyway. We store our SQL scripts in _src/main/resources/db/migration_. The migration is then automatically executed during startup of the application if it has not yet been applied to the database. Flyway keeps track if a script has already been applied with the table _flyway_schema_history_ in the database.
