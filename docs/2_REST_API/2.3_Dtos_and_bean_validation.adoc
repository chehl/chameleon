== 2.3 Dtos and bean validation

_Data transfer objects (Dtos)_ are nothing more than container classes that expose data. A Dto is helpful whenever you need to group values together for passing data around.

Dtos have several advantages:

* We further decouple the API / presentation from the domain. The data contract of the Dto describes the data the REST controller receives, but it is not a system-specific class, like a domain class or an entity class.
* We can describe the Dtos with OpenAPI schema.
* We can use *bean validation* to validate the received data. Please note that we have to annotate the method parameters with *@Valid* to enable bean validation in the controller.
