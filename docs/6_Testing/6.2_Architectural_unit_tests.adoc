== 6.2 Architectural unit tests

Architectural unit tests ensure that architectural rules and decisions are followed. For our application, we have written architectural unit tests with _ArchUnit_ (see link:https://www.archunit.org[archunit.org]) in class xref:../../src/test/java/cde/chameleon/ChameleonArchitectureTest.java[cde.chameleon.ChameleonArchitectureTest] to ensure that the hexagonal architecture is not violated.
