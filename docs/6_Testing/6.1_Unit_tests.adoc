== 6.1 Unit tests

Unit tests are *white-box tests* that ensure that the code we have written actually does what we intend it to do. They should follow the clear structure of *Arrance -> Act -> Assert (AAA)* or *Given -> When -> Then (GWT)*. Unit test should have descriptive, self-explanatory and self-documenting names. It is good practice to write the unit tests before the production code. This practice is called *test-driven development (TDD)*.

We use _JUnit5_, _Mockito_ (for mocks), and _Google Truth_ (for assertions) to implement the unit tests.
