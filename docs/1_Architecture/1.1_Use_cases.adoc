== 1.1 Use cases

The application manages _locations_ - with `id`, `name`, `address`, and GPS coordinates (i.e., `latitude` and `longitude`). It provides CRUD operations on these _locations_, including partial updates. In addition, the application supports the calculation of the distance between two given _locations_.
